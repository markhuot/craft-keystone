Keystone
==

The page builder experience for [Craft CMS](https://www.craftcms.com)! Build complex pages without even touching a single
template. Keystone allows you to organize your content in to components that can be endlessly nested and styled all from
the Craft control panel.

## Default Components

Keystone ships with a few default components to get you started, but it really should be extended per-site to provide
all the components your site needs. The foundational components that come out-of-the-box are,

* Asset
* Heading
* Link
* Section
* Text

By combining those you can create a page that looks like the above screenshot. Notice how the text is nested within a
heading because, like HTML, components can take any number of children to make vibrantly rich experiences.

## Creating your own components

Creating a component is as simple as adding a `.tiwg` file to your site's templates directory. Say you wanted to build a
`card` component. You would create a file in the `templates/components` directory named `card.twig`. Keystone automatically
picks up any components in that directory.

The `card.twig` file could contain something like this,

```twig
<div {{ attributes }}>
    <div>{% slot "media" %}{% endslot %}</div>
    <div>{{ props.heading }}</div>
    <div>{% slot %}{% endslot %}</div>
</div>
```

That would create a new "Card" component that has a `heading` field and two slots. The heading field could be updated in
a normal Craft plain text field and the two slots would take any nested components you wanted to place in them. 

It could also contain something much more complex, like this,

```twig
{# The default name would be `Card` based on the filename of `card.twig` #}
{% export name = "My Great Card" %}

{# The default icon would be a puzzle piece, but you can override that with any SVG here #}
{% export icon %}<svg...>{% endexport %}

{# Any `prop` that is accessed below will automatically become a plain text field #}
{# If you want to override that you can export propTypes for any field you want to #}
{# provide more information for. #}
{% export propTypes = {
    heading: field('plaintext')
} %}

{# The `attributes` array will come out of the Keystone "Design" tab. You can provide #}
{# defaults for the user via `attributes.merge()`. #}
<div {{ attributes.merge({class: 'border-2 border-gray-500 rounded-lg p-2 space-y-2'}) }}>

    {# Slots can be restricted to only allow specific component types so you can tell #}
    {# an area like that that it should only display assets #}
    <div>{% slot "media" allow ["keystone/asset"] %}{% endslot %}</div>
    
    {# Any field accessed on `props` will be available to edit in the Craft CP #}
    <div class="text-2xl font-bold">{{ props.heading }}</div>
    
    {# The default `slot` #}
    <div>{% slot %}{% endslot %}</div>
</div>
```

## Design

The Keystone Designer is configured out of the box to work with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com). Any design
attributes set in the UI such as a padding of `4rem` will be converted in to a Tailwind class of `p-[4rem]`.
